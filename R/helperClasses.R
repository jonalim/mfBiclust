#' A pair of matrix factors
#' 
#' Two matrices that can be thresholded to determine which samples and
#' features are members of which biclusters. After running a
#' matrix-factorization biclustering method, such as SVD-PCA, ALS-NMF, or SNMF,
#' these matrices will be score and loading matrices.
#' @slot W an m x k matrix

#' A biclustering algorithm result

#' Contains the results and metadata from running a biclustering algorithm.
