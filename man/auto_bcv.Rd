\title{Perform bcv until convergence}
\usage{
auto_bcv(Y, ks, holdouts = 10L, maxIter = 100L, tol = (10^-4),
  bestOnly = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, duplicable = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{the input matrix}

\item{ks}{a vector of bicluster quantities to consider}

\item{maxIter}{maximum number of iterations}

\item{tol}{tolerance used to determine convergence}

\item{bestOnly}{if FALSE, both the predicted number of biclusters and a table
of result counts is returned}
}
\description{
Performs BCV until the the distribution of results has converged. Often this
requires less than 50 iterations.
}
\details{
The returned number of biclusters is the median of the results from
\code{maxIter} iterations.
}
\section{Deciding the maximum k}{

To tune kLimit, it might be helpful to run with \code{maxIter} around 10 and
\code{bestOnly = TRUE} to determine if there is an obvious upper bound on the
results.
