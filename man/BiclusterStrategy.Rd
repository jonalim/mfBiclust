\section{Custom thresholds}{

When giving custom thresholds, various common use cases are assumed based on
the data type: A single numeric will be applied to all clusters. A vector of
numerics, if the same size as k, will be assumed to have a 1:1 relation with
k. A matrix of numerics, if k x Y for any Y, will be assumed to be a matrix
of thresholds, where each row k contains multiple thresholds to plot for
bicluster k. The first threshold will be applied to determine bicluster
members.

Careful! Use of NIPALS-PCA is not allowed when data is not missing. (NIPALS
is very slow.) Note: when Spectral, can provide minR as the minimum fraction of rows/columns that can constitute a cluster.

To be added: factorize: sparsenmf, plaid, bimax.
To be added: threshold: ita, fcm
