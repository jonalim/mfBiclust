\title{Perform bi-cross-validation}
\usage{
bcv(Y, ks, holdouts = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{the input matrix}

\item{holdouts}{the number of holdouts to perform along each dimension of
matrix \code{Y}}

\item{kLimit}{the maximum number of biclusters to evaluate}
}
\description{
The number of biclusters yielding the lowest BCV value is the predicted best.
It is recommended to use auto_bcv to perform several replications of
bi-cross-validation, and use the median of the results as the predicted
number of biclusters.
}
\details{
A named vector of BCV values corresponding to the various numbers of
biclusters evaluated.
