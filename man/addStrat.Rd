\title{Add a BiclusterStrategy to a BiclusterExperiment}
\usage{
addStrat(bce, k, method = c("als-nmf", "svd-pca", "snmf", "nipals-pca",
  "plaid", "spectral"), duplicable = TRUE, silent = FALSE, ...)
}
\description{
Due to requirements of various biclustering methods, this function may warn
that the chosen biclustering method was overridden.
}
\details{
Also, if any matrix elements of abund(BiclusterExperiment) are missing, then
the BiclusterExperiment returned is not guaranteed to have the same number of
samples and features.

Optional boolean argument \code{duplicable} can force Spectral, Plaid, 
NIPALS, and SNMF to be duplicable. Alternatively, can allow ALS-NMF to be 
non-duplicable. Other arguments to specific functions in bicluster.R can be
provided.
