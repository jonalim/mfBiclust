\usage{
addStrat(bce, k, method, maxNa = 1, ...)
}
\description{
Due to requirements of various biclustering methods, this function may warn
that the chosen biclustering method was overridden.
}
\details{
Also, if any matrix elements of abund(BiclusterExperiment) are missing, then
the BiclusterExperiment returned is not guaranteed to have the same number of
samples and features.

Optional boolean argument duplicable can force Spectral, Plaid, NIPALS, and
SNMF to be duplicable. Alternatively, can allow ALS-NMF to be non-duplicable.
